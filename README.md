### Log 

- 010723 ran into some issues with getting the dependencies downloaded and my envirornment (conda) correct. The error ended up being that I had python 3.12, which some of the versions of the dependencies did not support. I downgraded to 3.11 per ZenML docs and it seems I have all of the necessary dependencies installed.
